# Arduino Serial Message Input

This Arduino sketch allows you to input a message through the serial monitor and displays it back.

## Description

The code prompts the user to enter a message via the serial monitor. After receiving the input, it displays the entered message back to the user.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE (or any serial terminal program).
3. Enter your desired message and press Enter.
4. The entered message will be displayed back to you through the serial monitor.

## Observations

- The serial monitor is used to input and display the message.
- The Arduino reads the message input and sends it back to the serial monitor for display.

## Additional Details

- Adjust the code and connections as necessary based on your specific setup.
- Use caution when working with serial communication, especially if used in sensitive environments.
