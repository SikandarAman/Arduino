# Arduino LED Blink

This project demonstrates how to blink an LED using an Arduino board.

## Description

This simple Arduino sketch blinks an LED connected to pin 13 on the board. It provides a basic example for beginners to understand digital output and timing functions.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- LED
- Resistor 220 ohms

## Assembling Guide

1. Connect the positive (longer) leg of the LED to digital pin 13 on the Arduino board.
2. Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the LED to ground (GND) on the Arduino board.
3. If needed, insert a resistor between the LED and the digital pin to limit the current.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. The LED connected to pin 13 should start blinking with a 1-second interval.

## Observations

- The LED blinks on and off in a regular pattern.
- The delay between blinks is 1 second.

## Additional Details

- Feel free to modify the delay values in the code to change the blinking speed.
- Ensure proper polarity when connecting the LED to avoid damaging it or the Arduino board.
