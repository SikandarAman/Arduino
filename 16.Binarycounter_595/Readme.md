# Arduino Binary Counter using 74HC595 Shift Register

This Arduino sketch implements a binary counter using the 74HC595 shift register.

## Description

The code utilizes the 74HC595 shift register to create a binary counter. Three pins of the Arduino board (latchPin, clockPin, and dataPin) are connected to the corresponding pins (ST_CP, SH_CP, and DS) of the 74HC595 shift register. The sketch continuously updates the state of the shift register to display binary numbers from 0 to 255 on LEDs or other output devices.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- 74HC595 shift register
- LEDs or other output devices
- Resistors (if necessary)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Assembling Guide

1. Connect the latchPin of the Arduino to the ST_CP pin of the 74HC595.
2. Connect the clockPin of the Arduino to the SH_CP pin of the 74HC595.
3. Connect the dataPin of the Arduino to the DS pin of the 74HC595.
4. Connect LEDs or other output devices to the output pins of the 74HC595.
5. Ensure proper connections and polarity when connecting the components.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Observe the LEDs or other output devices connected to the output pins of the 74HC595 shift register.
3. The output will display binary numbers from 00000000 to 11111111 (0 to 255 in decimal) in sequence.

## Observations

- The sketch demonstrates using the 74HC595 shift register to create a binary counter.
- Each increment increases the displayed binary number by one, cycling from 00000000 to 11111111.
- The serial monitor can be used to observe the decimal and binary representations of the counter values.

## Additional Details

- The 74HC595 shift register allows for controlling multiple outputs with fewer Arduino pins, making it suitable for applications requiring a large number of outputs.
- Experiment with different output devices and configurations to create customized displays or control systems.
- Ensure proper current limiting for the LEDs or other output devices to avoid damaging them or the Arduino board.
