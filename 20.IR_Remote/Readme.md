# Arduino Infrared (IR) Remote Control

This Arduino sketch demonstrates using an IR receiver module to detect signals from an infrared remote control.

## Description

The code utilizes an IR receiver module connected to the Arduino board to detect signals from an IR remote control. When a signal is received, the decoded raw data in hexadecimal format is printed to the serial monitor. Additionally, the code checks if the received signal matches a predefined hexadecimal value (0xE916FF00 in this case), indicating a specific command from the remote. If the received signal matches the predefined value, the danger pin (pin 10) is set to HIGH, otherwise, it is set to LOW.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- IR receiver module (e.g., TSOP38238)
- Infrared (IR) remote control
- Resistors (if necessary)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Assembling Guide

1. Connect the IR receiver module to the Arduino board.
2. Connect the signal (OUT) pin of the IR receiver module to digital pin 9 of the Arduino.
3. Connect the power (VCC) pin of the IR receiver module to 5V on the Arduino.
4. Connect the ground (GND) pin of the IR receiver module to GND on the Arduino.
5. Connect any additional components required for your specific setup (e.g., LEDs or other output devices).

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the decoded IR signals.
3. Point an IR remote control towards the IR receiver module and press buttons.
4. Observe the serial monitor to see the decoded raw data in hexadecimal format.
5. Verify if the predefined hexadecimal value matches the signal from the remote control.

## Observations

- Each button press on the IR remote control sends a unique signal that can be decoded by the IR receiver module.
- Different IR remote controls may have different hexadecimal values for each button press.
- The predefined hexadecimal value in the code must match the specific command from the IR remote control to trigger the desired action.

## Additional Details

- The IRremote library simplifies interfacing with IR receiver modules on Arduino.
- Experiment with different IR remote controls and buttons to observe their respective hexadecimal values.
- Ensure proper line-of-sight and distance between the IR remote control and the IR receiver module for reliable signal reception.
- Adjust the predefined hexadecimal value in the code to match the command sent by your IR remote control.
