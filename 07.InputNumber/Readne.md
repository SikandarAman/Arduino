# Arduino LED Blink Control via Serial Input

This Arduino sketch allows you to control the blinking of an LED by entering the number of blinks through the serial monitor.

## Description

The code prompts the user to enter the number of times they want the LED connected to pin 8 to blink via the serial monitor. After receiving the input, it blinks the LED accordingly.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- LED
- Resistor 220 ohms
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Assembling Guide

1. Connect an LED to digital pin 8 on the Arduino board.
2. Ensure proper connections and polarity when connecting the LED.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE (or any serial terminal program).
3. Enter the desired number of blinks and press Enter.
4. The LED will blink the specified number of times with a 500ms on-off cycle.

## Observations

- The serial monitor is used to input the number of blinks.
- The LED blinks according to the input received.

## Additional Details

- Adjust the code and connections as necessary based on your specific setup.
- Ensure proper current limiting for the LED to avoid damaging it or the Arduino board.
- Use caution when working with blinking lights, especially if they are used in environments with sensitive individuals.
