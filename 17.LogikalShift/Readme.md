# Arduino Logical Shift Operation with 74HC595 Shift Register

This Arduino sketch demonstrates logical shift operations using the 74HC595 shift register.

## Description

The code utilizes the 74HC595 shift register to perform logical shift operations on a byte variable (`myByte`). The byte value is shifted either left or right in each iteration of the loop, simulating circular left shift operation. The output is then displayed on LEDs or other output devices connected to the output pins of the shift register.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- 74HC595 shift register
- LEDs or other output devices
- Resistors (if necessary)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Assembling Guide

1. Connect the latchPin of the Arduino to the ST_CP pin of the 74HC595.
2. Connect the clockPin of the Arduino to the SH_CP pin of the 74HC595.
3. Connect the dataPin of the Arduino to the DS pin of the 74HC595.
4. Connect LEDs or other output devices to the output pins of the 74HC595.
5. Ensure proper connections and polarity when connecting the components.

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Observe the LEDs or other output devices connected to the output pins of the 74HC595 shift register.
3. The output will display the logical shift operation performed on the byte value, simulating circular left shift operation.

## Observations

- The sketch demonstrates using the 74HC595 shift register to perform logical shift operations.
- Each iteration of the loop performs a circular left shift operation on the byte value, which is then displayed on the output devices.

## Additional Details

- Logical shift operations are commonly used in digital systems to shift the bits of a binary value left or right.
- Circular shift operations maintain the integrity of the shifted value by wrapping around the bits that are shifted out.
- Experiment with different byte values and shift operations to create customized patterns or effects on the output devices.
- Ensure proper current limiting for the LEDs or other output devices to avoid damaging them or the Arduino board.
