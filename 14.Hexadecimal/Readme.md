# Arduino Hexadecimal Byte Increment

This Arduino sketch demonstrates incrementing and printing a byte variable in hexadecimal format.

## Description

The code initializes a byte variable (`myByte`) to 0 and continuously increments its value. It then prints the value of `myByte` in hexadecimal format to the serial monitor. This allows you to observe the byte variable as it increments through hexadecimal values from 00 to FF.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE (or any serial terminal program).
3. Observe the serial monitor to see the hexadecimal values of `myByte` incrementing from 00 to FF.

## Observations

- The code prints the value of the byte variable `myByte` in hexadecimal format.
- The hexadecimal values range from 00 to FF as the byte variable increments.
- The delay between increments can be adjusted by modifying the delay duration in the code.

## Additional Details

- Hexadecimal notation is commonly used in programming to represent numbers in base 16.
- Each digit in a hexadecimal number represents a value from 0 to 15 (0-9 for digits 0-9, and A-F for digits 10-15).
- This sketch demonstrates how to print and manipulate byte variables in hexadecimal format.
