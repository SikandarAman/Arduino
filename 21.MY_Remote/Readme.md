# Arduino IR Remote Control with Custom Commands

This Arduino sketch demonstrates using an IR receiver module to detect signals from an infrared remote control and execute custom commands based on the received signals.

## Description

The code utilizes an IR receiver module connected to the Arduino board to detect signals from an IR remote control. When a signal is received, the decoded raw data in hexadecimal format is printed to the serial monitor. The code then checks the received signal against a list of predefined hexadecimal values corresponding to specific commands from the remote control. If the received signal matches any of the predefined values, the corresponding command is executed and printed to the serial monitor. If no match is found, an "Unknown signal" message is printed.

## Components Required

- Arduino board
- IR receiver module (e.g., TSOP38238)
- Infrared (IR) remote control
- Resistors (if necessary)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

## Assembling Guide

1. Connect the IR receiver module to the Arduino board.
2. Connect the signal (OUT) pin of the IR receiver module to digital pin 9 of the Arduino.
3. Connect the power (VCC) pin of the IR receiver module to 5V on the Arduino.
4. Connect the ground (GND) pin of the IR receiver module to GND on the Arduino.
5. Connect any additional components required for your specific setup (e.g., LEDs or other output devices).

## Usage

1. Upload the provided Arduino sketch to the Arduino board.
2. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the decoded IR signals.
3. Point an IR remote control towards the IR receiver module and press buttons.
4. Observe the serial monitor to see the decoded raw data in hexadecimal format and the corresponding commands executed.

## Observations

- Each button press on the IR remote control sends a unique signal that can be decoded by the IR receiver module.
- The code matches the received signal against a list of predefined hexadecimal values to execute specific commands.
- An "Unknown signal" message is printed if the received signal does not match any predefined value.

## Additional Details

- Different IR remote controls may have different hexadecimal values for each button press.
- Ensure the predefined hexadecimal values in the code match the commands sent by your IR remote control.
- Experiment with custom commands and responses based on the signals received from the IR remote control.
- Ensure proper line-of-sight and distance between the IR remote control and the IR receiver module for reliable signal reception.
